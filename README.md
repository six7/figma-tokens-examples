# Figma Tokens: Example repos
Collection of starter templates for a Figma Tokens GitHub sync. The examples can be used as a source repositor containing your tokens.json file. They all include GitHub Actions which transforms the tokens on each push to something Style Dictionary can read, which in turn transforms to something else. In these examples generated output files are automatically committed to the repository again, which is something you probably won't need as you'd include that in your build process.
